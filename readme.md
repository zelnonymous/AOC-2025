# 🎅🎄🎁 Advent of Code 2025 🎁🎄🎅

I am long overdue to explore Rust more deeply, so this year, I have decided to join
the rustaceans for Advent of Code!

I will be starting with a simple layout where each day is a binary crate, but with 
all crates in the same package.  To run day 1, for example:

```
cargo run --bin day1
```

I may opt to evolve this at some point by adding a main binary that can execute 
individual days via args or something similar, but starting simple while I learn the
language.
